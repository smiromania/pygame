# Racing a Drunk Driver

Description:
    A simple game where a bug that caused the npc not to always follow the path was transformed into a feature, he is now drunk.
    You can play using WASD (Red Sandero) or the arrow keys (White Dacia Logan).
    The Dacia Sandero is faster but has a lower maneuvrability rather than the Dacia Logan.
    This games requires some patience because always running fast is not going to help you, more of the opposite I'd say. If you hit an invisible wall you get bounced back at the exact speed you were at so consider breaking sometimes.
    The Goal of the game is to beat the green car, in which is the drunk driver, ten times in a row, otherwise you will lose and the game will crash itself (sometimes).
    Good luck!
    
Features:
    Multiplayer CO-OP up to two players.
